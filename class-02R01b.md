### Summary :

- HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

- They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

### CSS:(We have Q about add a new font from web)

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like). 

* Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties.

* For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.
