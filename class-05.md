## Img

To add an image into the page
you need to use an <img>
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:
src
This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site. (Here you can see that
the images are in a child folder
called images â€” relative URLs
were covered on pages 83-84).
alt
This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.
title
You can also use the title
attribute with the <img> element
to provide additional information
about the image. Most browsers
will display the content of this
attribute in a tootip when the
user hovers over the image.

Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency, or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations.
